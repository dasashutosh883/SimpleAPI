## CI/CD with Azure DevOps

### Pipeline Setup

1. Sign in to your [Azure DevOps account](https://dev.azure.com/).
2. Create a new project if you don't have one.
3. Navigate to the Pipelines section and create a new pipeline.
4. Connect your repository to Azure DevOps.
5. Configure the pipeline using the `azure-pipelines.yml` file in the root of your repository.

### Build Pipeline

The build pipeline (`azure-pipelines.yml`) includes the following steps:

1. Restore dependencies.
2. Build the solution.
3. Run unit tests.
4. Publish the build artifacts.

### Release Pipeline

1. Navigate to the Releases section in Azure DevOps.
2. Create a new release pipeline.
3. Add an artifact, linking it to the build pipeline.
4. Define the stages for your release (e.g., Development, Staging, Production).
5. Configure deployment tasks for each stage, such as deploying to Azure App Service.

## Contributing

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/YourFeature`).
3. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add some feature'`).
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin feature/YourFeature`).
5. Create a new Pull Request.
